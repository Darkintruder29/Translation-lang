## Overview
The **Speak & Translate System** is a Python-based application that enables users to translate spoken language into text and vice versa. It utilizes **Google Translate API, gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech), and SpeechRecognition** to provide an intuitive and efficient speech translation experience. The GUI is built using **Tkinter**, making it user-friendly and easy to navigate.

## Features
- **Speech-to-Text:** Convert spoken language into text.
- **Text Translation:** Translate text from one language to another using Google Translate API.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Convert translated text into speech using gTTS.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Built with Tkinter for ease of use.
- **Multi-language Support:** Supports a variety of languages for translation.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Tkinter** (GUI development)
- **Google Translate API** (for text translation)
- **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)** (for speech synthesis)
- **SpeechRecognition** (for voice input processing)
